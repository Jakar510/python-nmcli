SYNOPSIS
       nmcli [OPTIONS...] {help | general | networking | radio | connection | device | agent | monitor} [COMMAND] [ARGUMENTS...]




DESCRIPTION
       nmcli is a command-line tool for controlling NetworkManager and reporting network status. It can be utilized as a replacement for nm-applet or other graphical clients.  nmcli is used to create, display, edit, delete, activate, and deactivate network connections, as well as control and display network device status.

       Typical uses include:

       路   Scripts: Utilize NetworkManager via nmcli instead of managing network connections manually.  nmcli supports a terse output format which is better suited for script processing. Note that NetworkManager can also execute scripts, called "dispatcher scripts", in response to network events. See NetworkManager(8) for details
           about these dispatcher scripts.

       路   Servers, headless machines, and terminals: nmcli can be used to control NetworkManager without a GUI, including creating, editing, starting and stopping network connections and viewing network status.




OPTIONS

       -t | --terse
           Output is terse. This mode is designed and suitable for computer (script) processing.




       -p | --pretty
           Output is pretty. This causes nmcli to produce easily readable outputs for humans, i.e. values are aligned, headers are printed, etc.




       -m | --mode {tabular | multiline}
           Switch between tabular and multiline output:

           tabular
               Output is a table where each line describes a single entry. Columns define particular properties of the entry.

           multiline
               Each entry comprises multiple lines, each property on its own line. The values are prefixed with the property name.

           If omitted, default is tabular for most commands. For the commands producing more structured information, that cannot be displayed on a single line, default is multiline. Currently, they are:

           路   nmcli connection show ID
           路   nmcli device show




       -c | --colors {yes | no | auto}
           This option controls color output (using terminal escape sequences).  yes enables colors, no disables them, auto only produces colors when standard output is directed to a terminal. The default value is auto.




       -f | --fields {field1,field2... | all | common}
           This option is used to specify what fields (column names) should be printed. Valid field names differ for specific commands. List available fields by providing an invalid value to the --fields option.  all is used to print all valid field values of the command.  common is used to print common field values of the
           command.

           If omitted, default is common.




       -g | --get-values {field1,field2... | all | common}
           This option is used to print values from specific fields. It is basically a shortcut for --mode tabular --terse --fields and is a convenient way to retrieve values for particular fields. The values are printed one per line without headers.

           If a section is specified instead of a field, the section name will be printed followed by colon separated values of the fields belonging to that section, all on the same line.




       -e | --escape {yes | no}
           Whether to escape : and \ characters in terse tabular mode. The escape character is \.

           If omitted, default is yes.




       -a | --ask
           When using this option nmcli will stop and ask for any missing required arguments, so do not use this option for non-interactive purposes like scripts. This option controls, for example, whether you will be prompted for a password if it is required for connecting to a network.




       -s | --show-secrets
           When using this option nmcli will display passwords and secrets that might be present in an output of an operation. This option also influences echoing passwords typed by user as an input.




       -w | --wait seconds
           This option sets a timeout period for which nmcli will wait for NetworkManager to finish operations. It is especially useful for commands that may take a longer time to complete, e.g. connection activation.

           Specifying a value of 0 instructs nmcli not to wait but to exit immediately with a status of success. The default value depends on the executed command.




       --complete-args
           Instead of conducting the desired action, nmcli will list possible completions for the last argument. This is useful to implement argument completion in shell.

           The exit status will indicate success or return a code 65 to indicate the last argument is a file name.

           NetworkManager ships with command completion support for GNU Bash.




       -v | --version
           Show nmcli version.




       -h | --help
           Print help information.
